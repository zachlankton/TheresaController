## The original implementation used an Onion Omega2 Microcontroller as the main brain and the teensy 3.6 as the 16 channel heater band monitor. (Shown in the picture below).  This proved to be unreliable in an industrial environment and burned up due to heat in the first couple months.  The project was then updated and rewired to work with a Raspberry Pi Nano W and has been in operation for over 3 years without any hardware failure.
